# DH150-Assignment06-LowFidelityPrototype
### by Amanda Ruan

## Description of Project:
The project aims to establish an app (based on current government health websites and other COVID-19 related apps) that provides COVID-19 information to the public. Specifically, the app shows a COVID-19 tracker map, presents graphs on COVID-19 development trends, updates both national and local official orders or notices, news, and related health information, and provides a Q&A section for individuals with specific needs or concerns. This project aims to provide easy access to information and help for the general public regarding the current pandemic. 

### Personas + Features:
With the hope to capture the characteristics of a large population, who are the potential target users of this app, I created three personas and task scenarios based on usability testing of other similar apps and websites and contextual inquiry. Some characteristics of the personas include that they all have secondary education, have individual phone that could access to the app, and have different needs related to the current pandemic. 

The three features include 1) __Interactive map/statistic visualization tool__, which helps users to track the spread of COVID19 based on case numbers that are reported on different geographical and demographical levels, such as neighborhoods, communities, and cities. 2)__Q&A tool__, which provides responses and helps to individuals who have specific concerns or questions related to the pandemic. 3) __Official resources/announcements page__, which updates government announcements and organizes resources on different geographical and demographical levels and allows users to search for information they want.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to see whether the features work as I expected and whether a potential user can easily navigate through the features and finds what he/she needs.
