# DH150-Assignment06-LowFidelityPrototype
### by Amanda Ruan

## Description:
The project aims to establish an app (based on current government health websites and other COVID-19 related apps) that provides COVID-19 information to the public. Specifically, the app shows a COVID-19 tracker map, presents graphs on COVID-19 development trends, updates both national and local official orders or notices, news, and related health information, and provides a Q&A section for individuals with specific needs or concerns. This project aims to provide easy access to information and help for the general public regarding the current pandemic. 

#### Personas + Features:
With the hope to capture the characteristics of a large population, who are the potential target users of this app, I created three personas and task scenarios based on usability testing of other similar apps and websites and contextual inquiry. Some characteristics of the personas include that they all have secondary education, have individual phone that could access to the app, and have different needs related to the current pandemic. 

The three features include 1) __Interactive map/statistic visualization tool__, which helps users to track the spread of COVID19 based on case numbers that are reported on different geographical and demographical levels, such as neighborhoods, communities, and cities. 2) __Q&A tool__, which provides responses and helps to individuals who have specific concerns or questions related to the pandemic. 3) __Official resources/announcements page__, which updates government announcements and organizes resources on different geographical and demographical levels and allows users to search for information they want.

#### Purpose:
The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to see whether the features work as I expected and whether a potential user can easily navigate through the features and finds what he/she needs.

## Task 1: 
### Find the spread of active cases in 1) California and in 2) Westwood on the interactive map

### 4. Notes and Reflection:
- I thought the tester would first zoom in and out of the map (as the first intuition when seeing the map) but she directly “searched” for the location using the search bar tool. During the process, 1) the tester was first confused about whether she could press the “active” label on the info box of the map, and was confused about the filter buttons at the top bar. She did not see the “active” filter button at the beginning.After I explained, she realized that can press the “active” filter button on the top of the map. 2) The tester was also confused about the drop-down filter button and the information box, because I did not draw the full frames out for the two features but only draw the sub-frames. This also remains me of consistency in design as the tester got confused on something that I did not keep consistent.
- Based on the tester’s interaction, I would make the following changes to the map feature. 1) I would establish a tutorial motion on the map page for everyone new to the app. The tutorial motion would use lead the user to each feature on the page and the steps she/he might go through. For instance, the tutorial motion would first point to the top filter bar and suggest a user to press any of the button filter, such as “active cases” After pressing, the user would find that the map only show the spread of “active cases”. 2) I would consider to add filter buttons too on the info box of the map, which I first intended to only show the information without any interactive element. So when a user presses on the information, it would function as the filter button too. 

  

## Task 2: 
### Use Q&A tool to look for mental health online call line

### 4. Notes and Reflection:
- The whole process for the second task went mostly smoothly. I noticed that the tester’s interaction process was to first “clicked” the click button of submitting questions, then went back to the main Q&A page to try to search for the questions on the “frequently asked questions”, and lastly was to search for the keywords using the search bar.
She was able to find the “back” button to go back to previous pages. I did not expect that the tester first went to the “click and submit your question” page. She later explained that she wanted to explore the pages first. The tester was confused about the scrolling bar because she did not know what that was, mainly because I did not draw it well. 
- If I would revise the prototype, 1) I would first represent the scrolling bar more saliently and recognizable. 2) Then I might try to prompt a user to search for questions to see whether there are similar questions first before submitting his/her own questions. I would also try to create more prototype pages for the live chat page, to ensure that even if a user does not find the questions they want, the live chat could first generate robot responses related to the user’s questions then prompt the user to submit his/her own questions if he/she could not find similar questions. 



## Task 3: 
### Search for 1) local testing booths information and 2) restaurants information under official resources/announcements page

### 4. Notes and Reflection:
- The entire process also went smoothly for this task. She was confused at first because of my bad handwriting (sorry), but then she understood the labels and names and can complete the task fast. She also realized that the testing booths information was listed by proximity to a user’s location. On of the main problems she have was 1) the “more” button on the main page under the “Guidance Updates” section. I did not draw the prototype of where the button could lead to, so the tester questioned about the button and asked if she could find the information she wanted there. 2) The second questions was the “date” button under the “filter” drop down bar on the “Latest Announcements” section. She questioned whether she could modify a date range or a specific date. 
- Her interactions provide useful feedbacks to me. I would first add more detailed prototypes to the pages so a tester can see where she/he can go to, such as the prototype after pressing the “more” button. I would also consider enabling both” date range” and “specific date” on the filter bar, so a user can have more freedom to customize the search and filter. When I was creating the prototypes, I did not consider the detailed functions or layouts of these features, but these details did catch the attention of the tester. This made me realize how detailed UI/UX design should go to provide a user easily understandable and accessible interactions.
